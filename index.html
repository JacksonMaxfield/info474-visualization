							Coming into this dataset I didn't have any real idea as to what it might indicate. What do the
							MIC scores mean and how much do they vary across the different antibiotics? So my first
							specific question was:

							<br><br><em>Which antibiotic has the highest average MIC scores across the various
							bacterial infections?</em><br><br>

							This is a good first question to ask as it allows the viewer to quickly understand
							that Penicilin is multiple times better than Streptomycin and Neomycin for many of the
							bacterial infections. By this I mean, it intuitively shows that Penicilin has high scores
							which, are usually associated with good performance.
							<br><br>
							I choose to rely on vertical length judgements for this question primarly because
							of how well they showed the drastic differences between the three antibiotics.
							The question of which has the highest average scores across the various bacterial infections
							is answered very quickly by looking at the chart and seeing the massive differences
							between the three drugs many vertical length judgements.
							<br><br>
							I also believe that there is sometimes a need to be less distint in the visualization.
							By this I mean, while it is obvious that Penicilin performs drastically better than the
							other antibiotics, it is also harder to understand much of the data from
							Streptomycin and Neomycin. This is once again because of the choice of length judgements as the
							primary elementary task for the viewer. I didn't want the viewer to try to dive into this
							data too much, I wanted them to look at the visualization, and ask more questions. By
							leaving a lot of data as somewhat illegible it forces the viewer to want to find out more
							and continue to ask questions.
							<br><br>
							One of the design questions I did ask myself multiple times however, was the importance of
							a legend. I felt that it wasn't needed as there was so much data, it felt a bit overbearing
							and from an understanding of the data, it wasn't needed because it would go against my
							reasoning for the visualization in the first place. I wanted a visualization that was
							easy to look at and get a general understanding of the data, and more importantly to
							encourage further questions.

							Now that the viewer has a bit of insight into the data and what it means, they can start
							to ask questions that might give more understanding of the data. My next question for
							the data:

							<br><br><em>If we looked only at the scores for bacterial infections that
							show positive to gram-staining, how would the data differ?</em><br><br>

							Similar to the first question, this question gives quick insight into how the three
							different antibiotics may function. From this visualization we see that, unlike the
							previous, Streptomycin and Neomycin perform much better than Penicilin
							when the bacterial infection shows positive to the gram-staining procedure.
							<br><br>
							Once again I used a grouped bar chart and the viewers elementary perceptual task of
							vertical length for this visualization. This time however I used it because I thought
							it was a good way to show actual data. The data points and values are in a range tight
							enough that the viewer can understand the scale of difference between the different
							antibiotics much better.
							<br><br>
							Much like in the first visualization, a secondary reason for the use of a grouped bar
							chart, was to allow the viewer an easy way to understand the data. The vertical judgements
							also create somewhat of a proximity perception. This was intentional because I wanted to
							further have the viewer understand that Penicilin was a different type of antibiotic than
							Streptomycin and Neomycin.
							<br><br>
							Unlike the first visualization I choose to keep the legend for this one mainly because
							the data is much more specific, giving the viewer a legend allows them, if they want to,
							to see each data point.

							What if the viewer is interested in only one type of antibiotic?

							<br><br><em>What are the MIC scores for only Neomycin?</em><br><br>

							Unlike the previous two visualizations, I used a dot chart for this question.
							In a similar fashion to a bar chart, I have broken up this data categorically for each
							of the different bacterial infections, and then assigned the appropriate y-value to the
							associated MIC score for Neomycin used on the bacterium. I have also assigned color to
							the differing type of bacterium, whether it can be gram-stained or not.
							<br><br>
							The main reason for forming a dot chart instead of a bar chart was because I felt that
							because there are many points that are so close to zero in this specific dataset, using
							specific points allows the viewer to visually see that, while it Neomycin was tested on
							the bacterium, it didn't perform well. Whereas, in a bar chart, viewers cannot visually
							see the bar of data.
							<br><br>
							This dot chart forces the viewer to once again make vertical length judgements, and I
							felt this was once again the best way to communicate the information. Additionally, combining
							the length judgements with color perception, allows the viewer to quickly and easily understand
							that Neomycin works well, if you could even say that, on only a few of the bacterial
							infections, of which, they work best on bacterium that mark positive after the Gram-staining
							process.
